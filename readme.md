The repository consists of implementation of Discrete Logarithm algorithm described by Michele Mosca and Artur Ekert - https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9903071.pdf

The code for Modular Exponentiation is referenced from the repository - https://github.com/mhinkie/ShorDiscreteLog/blob/main/shor/arithmetic/brg_mod_exp.py

Interpretion of results - 
-> The probability distribution will be represented as histograms, consider the first n bits (n = log N) as a suitable x, where g^x = h mod p.
